Once per day you can unleash the true power of The Twins and strike down your enemy. When you make an attack roll you gain advantage and deal an extra damage die equal to the weapons’ damage die.
United Means:
Once per day you can call upon The Twins and Unite your two weapons to form one great weapon. The new weapon has all the characteristics of both and does both of their damage die plus an additional damage die of the first weapon. United Means ends if you have not been in combat for 5 minutes or if you stop wielding the weapon with two hands.
Counter-Part:
Once per day you can call upon the Twins and summon your Counter-Part. The summoned being is a clone of you. When you use this ability, you can only wield a weapon in one hand, and the clone wields your other weapon in the opposite hand. You control your Counter-Part.

The ability to dual wield Two-Handed weapons is regained when your Counter-Part disappears.)

Saved by the bell:
You are “saved by the bell”. For one round of combat (six seconds) target enemy CANNOT make an attack against you.

Roll with the Punches:
When an enemy uses the same attack on you multiple times you can roll a d20 to potentially dodge it.
2nd attack: You must roll higher than an 18.
3rd attack: You must roll higher than a 16.
4th attack: You must roll higher than a 15.
Any attack after 4th decreases what you must roll to dodge by 1.

On the Ropes:
When you are under half health your AC increases by 1.

Killer Instinct:
Once per battle you may sense a “critical” spot on an enemy. Any attack made against this spot has advantage and does 1.5x damage.

Beat them to the Punch: 
When an enemy attacks you, you may use your reaction to punch it first.
